          <p>
            Soccer is the most popular team sport in Australia by participation, although levels
            of participation do differ by states and over time. In general participation has 
            increased over time, although COVID-19 had a significant impact on participation in 
            most states with Victoria and New South Wales being most affected.
          </p>

          <p>
            The difference in participation for males and females can be clearly seen on the line 
            graph and is consistent across all states of Australia. The differences between states 
            can be more accurately compared using the Choropleth map. Whilst Tasmania seems to have
            really good female participation compared to other states it is still only between 
            15-20% for any of the years shown. 
          </p>

          <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Gender Divide</h1>
          <p>
            This gender divide between male and female participation is highlighted in this 
            grid of area charts. With the y axis kept consistent between paired male and female 
            participation graphs it is clear to see the difference in participation across all types 
            of soccer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Interestingly, whilst <span class="btext" style="color: #882255;">New South Wales </span>
            has the most participants for both outdoor soccer and social soccer, <span class="btext" 
            style="color: #AA4499;">Victoria </span> has significantly greater futsal participation.
            <span class="btext" style="color: #882255;">New South Wales </span> larger population 
            could be contributing to the higher participation, however the degree of difference is too
            significant for population to be the sole driving force. The existance of two governing 
            bodies, Football New South Wales and Football Northern New South Wales is likely
            driving the higher participation as they can have double the number of leagues of competition. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Of all the types of soccer, social soccer has been least impacted by COVID-19, which is 
            predominantly due to the sharp rise in popularity in <span class="btext" style="color: 
            #CC6677;">Queensland</span>. In contrast to that, in <span class="btext" style="color: 
            #AA4499;">Victoria</span> participation levels dropped to 25% of pre-COVID levels 
            and have still not recovered.

          <p>
            Many people around the world play soccer professionally, meaning it is their primary source 
            of income. The graph to the right shows the number of professional level clubs and 
            professional male soccer players for each country in 2025. 
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="btext" style="color: #cc79a7;">Mexico</span> is a clear outlier to the right 
            with more double the number of professional clubs as the next largest country, 
            <span class="btext" style="color: #e41a1c;">Brazil</span>. <span class="btext" 
            style="color: #ff7f00;">Spain</span> is an outlier in the top left with only 42 
            professional clubs but 8,560 professional men's soccer players.

          <p>
            Domestic players are those who have grown up playing soccer in that country and 
            foreign players or imports are players who have moved for the purpose of playing
            soccer in that country. As shown on the graph, most countries use predominantly
            domestic players aside from <span class="btext">Europe</span>, where there are several
            countries with over 50% of players from foreign countries. These countries tend to be 
            small, often micronations where the local population is not large enough to produce 
            the quantity of players at the skill level required for the professional league.
          </p>

          <p>
            Countries in Africa have some of the lowest import rates in the world, likely due to 
            the cost associated with paying players to travel to and live in the country. This is 
            likely also a contributing factor to Europe having the highest import rates due to the 
            wealthier nations.
